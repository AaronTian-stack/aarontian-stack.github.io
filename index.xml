      <description>I am an undergraduate student studying computer science at the University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering. My interests are in computer graphics (working with 3D APIs such as Vulkan, OpenGL, and D3D11) and software engineering as a whole.&#xA;Most recently I was an intern at Intel Corporation where I worked on the 3D Performance team to evaluate and help improve driver performance on gaming and workstation Intel Arcâ„¢ GPUs.&#xA;Previously I was also an intern at Johns Hopkins APL where I developed virtual reality applications for data visualization.</description>
